# So for whatever fucking reason, the chameleon on /neck pieces specifically/ breaks if you have the item default be itself,
# so I need to make a dummy copy of each one in order for the description to tell you what the sodding thing does.
# Addendum to this, it's every chameleon piece with a non-base rsi, which sucks.
